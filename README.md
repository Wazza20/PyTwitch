# PyTwitch
# This python script can be used to create a stream via a linux box if you want that stream to run 24/7.

In order to use this script you need to install three things: screen, python3, ffmpeg and streamlink for twitch.

Script usage:

python3 scriptname.py start

Will update with more info soon, still under intense development.
