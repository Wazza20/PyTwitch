# PyTwitch
# This python script can be used to create a stream via a linux box if you want that stream to run 24/7.

In order to use this script you need to install three things: screen, python3, ffmpeg and streamlink for twitch.

Script usage:

python3 scriptname.py start

###Added a modified version of the code which does not require encoding, just deliviers the mp4 files directly(while keeping the gop size and function implemented), with the original quality, resolution and bitrate.

Will update with more info soon, still under intense development.
